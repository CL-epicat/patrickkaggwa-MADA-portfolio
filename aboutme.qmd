# About Me

[![**One evening during my Christmas break**](images/personal.png){fig-align="center"}](https://github.com/kagpatrick/patrickkaggwa-MADA-portfolio)

I am a first-year Ph.D. student, specializing in Epidemiology at the Global Health Institute. My background includes expertise in computer hardware, open-source systems, network design and deployments, Docker containerization, Linux, and Health Informatics.

## Background and Research Interests

I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Master's in Health Informatics. My research interests revolve around data science, AI, and the intersection of technology and health. I am currently working with Dr. Christopher Whalen and Dr. Juliet Sekandi at the Global Health Institute, focusing on TB research in Africa, specifically in Uganda.

I am actively involved in projects that leverage mobile digital technologies to enhance data collection, monitoring, and adherence in TB. Additionally, I explore the use of smartwatches in collecting mobility data for participants at risk of Latent Tuberculosis Infection (LTBI).

## Data Analysis Experience

While my data analysis skills are currently at a beginner's level, I have acquired knowledge in R through EPID8500 and SAS. I am motivated to enhance my analysis skills further.

## MADA Course Expectations

In the Modern Applied Data Analysis (MADA) course, I aim to improve my R programming skills and enhance my data analysis capabilities using modern tools. I expect to gain skills that will propel me toward a successful career in data science and AI.
