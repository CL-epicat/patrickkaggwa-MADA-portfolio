## About Data

The data was about the poll that was conducted from Sept. 15 to Sept. 25 among a sample of U.S. citizens that oversampled young, Black and Hispanic respondents, with 8,327 respondents, and was weighted according to general population benchmarks for U.S. citizens from the U.S.

Prompted chatgpt for the code: Prompt: Please generate R code to visualize demographic data, including variables such as race, income, age, and education, segmented by voter category. Ensure that each variable is plotted as a bar graph with custom colors for the voter categories and arrange the plots in a grid with two columns. After I adjusted the code to try fit what I wanted.

Nonvoters were more likely to have lower incomes; to be young; to have lower levels of education.

## About Data

The data used contains season-level advanced stats for WNBA players by team for the 1997-2019 seasons, from [Basketball-Reference.com](https://www.basketball-reference.com/). It also contains `Composite Rating`, which blends PER and Win Shares per 40 into a single metric that mimics [RAPTOR player ratings](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/introducing-raptor-our-new-metric-for-the-modern-nba/). I prompted chatgpt that produced a code, I didn't use it but it guided to write mine.

The original table to be reproduced. [![](/images/image2.png)](https://github.com/kagpatrick/patrickkaggwa-MADA-portfolio)

```{r}

# Filter the data to include only players who played at least 375 minutes
filtered_data <- wnba_player_stats %>%
  filter(MP >= 375)

# Renaming variables to fit the table 
filtered_data <- filtered_data %>%
  rename(
    PLAYER = Player,
    SEASON = year_ID,
    AGE = Age,
    TEAM = Tm,
    WS40 = WS40,
    COMPOSITE_RATING = Composite_Rating
  )
# Arrange the data to find the best single-season composite ratings
top_players <- filtered_data %>%
  arrange(desc(COMPOSITE_RATING)) %>%
  select(PLAYER, SEASON, AGE, TEAM, PER, WS40, COMPOSITE_RATING) %>%
  head(15)

# Create flextable for the top players
ft <- flextable(top_players)

# Print the flextable
ft
```

The table shows Cooper-Dyke's early WNBA seasons are among the best ever Best single-season composite ratings --- based on a mix of player efficiency rating (PER) and win shares per 40 minutes --- for WNBA players who played at least 375 minutes that season, 1997-2019
