# Summary/Abstract

*Write a summary of your project.*

{{< pagebreak >}}

# Introduction

## General Background Information

*Provide enough background on your topic that others can understand the why and how of your analysis*

## Description of data and data source

*Describe what the data is, what it contains, where it is from, etc. Eventually this might be part of a methods section.*

## Questions/Hypotheses to be addressed

{{< pagebreak >}}

# Methods

*Describe your methods. That should describe the data, the cleaning processes, and the analysis approaches. You might want to provide a shorter description here and all the details in the supplement.*

## Data aquisition

## Data import and cleaning

## Statistical analysis

*Explain anything related to your statistical analyses.*

# Results

## Exploratory/Descriptive analysis

```{r}
#| label: tbl-summarytable
#| tbl-cap: "Data summary table."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable=readRDS("../../results/tables-files/summarytable.rds")
knitr::kable(resulttable)
```

## Basic statistical analysis

Figure1: shows a scatterplot figure produced by one of the R scripts.

```{r}
#| label: Scatter plot
#| fig-cap: "The scatter shows a slight postive increase in the weight of individuals with increasing age."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("starter-analysis-exercise","results","figures","Weight-Age-stratified.png"))
```

Figure2: shows a Boxplot of Height and Education Levels.

```{r}
#| label: Box Plot
#| fig-cap: "The figure shows a box-plot of heights of individuals stratified by education levels."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("starter-analysis-exercise","results","figures","education-Height-stratified.png"))
```

## Full analysis

Table2: shows a summary of a linear model fit .

```{r}
#| label: table
#| tbl-cap: "Graduate, High school, and Undergraduate do not appear to be statistically significant as their p-values are higher than 0.05, Height of individuals increases by approximately by 1.08cm per one year increase in age."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable3 = readRDS(here("starter-analysis-exercise","results","tables-files","resulttable3.rds"))
knitr::kable(resulttable3)
```

## Code used for the analysis

```         
##############################################
### Box Plot
b1<-mydata %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = `Educ`, y = Height, fill = `Educ`)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("College" = "#1f78b4", "High school" = "#33a02c", "Graduate" = "#e31a1c", "Undergraduate" = "#ff7f00")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Education levels", y = "Height") +
  ggtitle("Boxplot of Education Levels by Height") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))  # Adjust title alignment
b1
figure_file = here("starter-analysis-exercise","results","figures","education-Height-stratified.png")
ggsave(filename = figure_file, plot=b1)
##############################################
For the scatter Plot
s1 <- ggplot(mydata, aes(x = Weight, y = age)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method = "glm", formula = y ~ x) +
  ggtitle("Scatterplot of Weight vs Age") +
  labs(x = "Weight", y = "Age")
s1
figure_file = here("starter-analysis-exercise","results","figures","Weight-Age-stratified.png")
ggsave(filename = figure_file, plot=s1)

############################
#### Third model fit
# fit linear model using height as outcome, age and Educatinal Levels as predictor

lmfit3 <- lm(Height ~ age + Educ, mydata)  

# place results from fit into a data frame with the tidy function
lmtable3 <- broom::tidy(lmfit3)

#look at fit results
print(lmtable3)

# save fit results table  
table_file3 = here("starter-analysis-exercise","results", "tables-files", "resulttable3.rds")
saveRDS(lmtable3, file = table_file3)
```

# Discussion

## Summary and Interpretation

*Summarize what you did, what you found and what it means.*

## Strengths and Limitations

*Discuss what you perceive as strengths and limitations of your analysis.*

## Conclusions

*What are the main take-home messages?*

*Include citations in your Rmd file using bibtex, the list of references will automatically be placed at the end*

This paper [@leek2015] discusses types of analyses.

These papers [@mckay2020; @mckay2020a] are good examples of papers published using a fully reproducible setup similar to the one shown in this template.
